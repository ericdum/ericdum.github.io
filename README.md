This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

This project is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages automatically using GitHub Actions.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Enable GitHub Pages in your repository:**
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Pages" in the left sidebar
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"

2. **Push to main branch:**
   - The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy your site
   - The workflow triggers on pushes to the `main` branch

3. **Access your site:**
   - If your repository is `username.github.io`, your site will be available at `https://username.github.io`
   - If your repository has a different name, your site will be available at `https://username.github.io/repository-name`
   - If you need to use a custom base path, update `next.config.ts` to include:
     ```typescript
     basePath: '/repository-name',
     ```

### Manual Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually:

```bash
npm run build
# The static files will be in the ./out directory
# You can then push the contents of ./out to the gh-pages branch
```
